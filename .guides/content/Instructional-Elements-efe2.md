## Core Components
### Each unit consistently has these key features.
<br>


||| growthhack
**Growth Hacks:**  Contain thought experiment content with critical thinking questions related to the topic. Growth Hacks are not auto graded and need to be checked/assessed by the instructor.
|||

||| meetups
**Meetups:**  Problem-solving or synthesis discussion questions that require small group interaction and presentation of findings to the larger group. Example: divide into pairs and small groups. Brainstorm for five minute about creative ways to make a secure channel in your school.  Share your ideas with the class.

|||definition
**Definition:**  Provides a definition of key terms. 
|||

|||create
**Creatorspace Lab:**  Emphasis on hands-on, creating, and creative, these are "try it" labs that use the Codio platform to encourage students to let their imaginations run loose, but perhaps not wild. 

Labs need to include step by step guidance and a grading rubric for instructors but can pose extensions for further student inquiry. 

Each lab includes a Lab Check In and a Growth Hack section.  The former is the workbook space for the students to complete their lab experience and check their understanding.  The latter provides  a critical thinking exploration of key lab points.  Read more about labs in the next section.

|||challenge
**Assessments:**  There are multiple assessment opportunities throughout the content. 
 - **Pre-Assessment:**  Each unit opens with a pre-assessment. This assesses the knowledge of students prior to the unit learning. It is useful in classes that benchmark formative learning or in courses where students can choose to skip what they know, and focus on the topics they have yet to master. 
 - **Unit Check In:**  A set of auto-graded assessment items that cover the unit's objective domain.
 - **Points to Ponder:**  Open-ended critical thinking questions that require the teacher to grade.
 - **Check Your Memory:**  A set of auto-graded assessment items that review key concepts presented in prior units.
 - **Growth Hacks:** Are critical thinking questions related to the topic. Growth Hacks are not auto graded and need to be checked/assessed by the instructor.
