Labs offer step by step guidance, then pose **Your Turn** extensions for further student inquiry. 

Each lab includes a **Lab Check In** and a **Growth Hack** section.  The former is the workbook space for the students to complete their lab experience and check their understanding.  The latter provides  a critical thinking exploration of key lab points.

**Assessments:**  There are multiple assessment opportunities throughout the module.  
 - **Pre-Assessment:**  Each unit opens with a pre-assessment. This assesses the knowledge of students prior to the unit learning.

 - **Unit Check In:**  A set of auto-graded assessment items that cover the unit's objective domain.
 - **Points to Ponder:**  Open-ended critical thinking questions that require the instructor to grade.
 - **Check Your Memory:**  A set of auto-graded assessment items that review key concepts presented in prior units.
 - **Growth Hacks:** Are critical thinking questions related to the topic. Growth Hacks are not auto graded and need to be reviewed and assessed by the instructor.
