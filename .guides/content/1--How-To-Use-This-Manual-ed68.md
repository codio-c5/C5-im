The curriculum provides interesting and relevant examples, collaborative and individual projects, and formative and summative assessments to keep learners engaged, and alert instructors when interventions might be necessary.


The Instructor's Manual is a guide to the Applied Cryptography module. It describes the module's prerequisites and objectives, the course structure and instructional elements, labs and assessments.

The Instructor's Manual does not describe the features and functionality of the Codio platform.  Codio features are thoroughly demonstrated in Codio's thorough documentation.
