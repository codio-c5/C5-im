## The Hackathon Experience

Codio's Hackathons are optional student experiences that instructors can ignore, or adapt and tailor to the needs of their students. They encourage students to create and collaborate together, and/or offer the opportunity for a deeper exploration of a particular branch of the unit or area of thought.

The Hackathons here also seek to inspire instructors to create their own student-centric explorations that take on new and unique directions that will excite and engage students.

# Hackathons by Unit

## Unit 1 Hackathons
**Hackathon  1.1: The Shift Cipher as a Block Flowchart**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 1.6: *Illustrate how symmetric key encryption works using software .*  
**The work:** This Hackathon is good for students who are budding programmers and who are thinking about how algorithms are developed through flowcharts.  It's more of a quick demonstration than it is a hands- on project. 
**On their own:** Students can explore flow options in Codio.

**Hackathon  1.2: The Problem of Key Distribution**
1.5: *Explain the challenge of key distribution in symmetric key encryption.* 
**The work:** This is great for creative types and kinesthetic learners. Students create different ideas about how to share a key securely over insecure channels.  They can explore dead drops, putting the key in a locker or lock box, or having a trusted courier.  Let them get zany and creative.
**On their own:** This can range from sharing ideas in the classroom to acting out the exchange.

## Unit 2 Hackathons
**Hackathon  2.1: Fermat's Little Theorem**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 2.1: *Explain how asymmetric (public key) encryption works.*  
**The work:** This Hackathon is good for students who are curious about math. It walks through Fermat's and Euler's thinking, and students will discover how what was generations ago merely theoretical math became the foundation for public key cryptography. 
**On their own:** Students can explore more about Fermat and Euler online.

**Hackathon  2.2: Inside RSA Encryption**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 2.1: *Explain how asymmetric (public key) encryption works;* 2.4 *Identify commonly used algorithms for asymmetric encryption.* 
  
**The work:**  This Hackathon is good for students who are curious about math. It shows how prime numbers and modular arithmetic are fundamental to RSA. 
**On their own:** Students can explore more about RSA online.

### Unit 3 and 4 have no Hackathons
