  ## The Assessment Experience
 The approach to assessments in Codio is different in Unit 1 from the other lessons.  As a pilot, we are interested to find out which approach you prefer.
 In Unit 1, assessments are used extensively in order to capture analytics about the student learning process.  The unit opens with a deep pre-assessment, and a rich set of items is sprinkled throughout the unit to capture formative learning, and then the unit end provides a deep set of assessment items to gather summative data.
 
 In contrast, Units 2-4 provide a briefer handful of pre-assessment items at the beginning of the unit, and a deep set at the end.  In the middle, items are used as knowledge checkpoints and reinforcements to help engage students and direct their thinking towards core concepts. 
 
After the pilot period, the module will also have a test item file as a part of this Instructor's Manual.  This will enable instructors to pick and choose a set of items to deliver to students as pop quizzes, midterms, finals, or whatever the instructor likes.
 
 
## Assessment Options
 As mentioned in the Instructional Elements, the module includes these opportunities for assessment. 
 
  - **Pre-Assessment:**  Each unit opens with a pre-assessment. This assesses the knowledge of students prior to the unit learning. It is useful in classes that benchmark formative learning or in courses where students can choose to skip what they know, and focus on the topics they have yet to master. 
 - **Unit Check In:**  A set of auto-graded assessment items that cover the unit's objective domain.
 - **Points to Ponder:**  Open-ended critical thinking questions that require the instrutor to grade.
 - **Check Your Memory:**  A set of auto-graded assessment items that review key concepts presented in prior units.
 - **Growth Hacks:** Are critical thinking questions related to the topic. Growth Hacks are not auto graded and need to be reviewed and assessed by the instructor.
  
  ## Assessment Types
Codio offers a a rich set of assessment types, and instructors have the option to use the items Codio provides, or to author their own items to further tailor the learning experience for their students.
