## The Lab Experience

Codio's CreatorSpace Labs provide students with a hands-on experience that is tied to the unit objectives.  

Each lab starts with a guided step by step example for students to follow. After, students are encouraged to experiment further on their own.

Last, each lab concludes with a Lab Check In where students answer two series of questions about what they learned. The first are auto-graded questions that check for knowledge gained.  The second are critical thinking questions that encourage students to apply and evaluate what they have learned.

# The Labs by Unit

## Unit 1 Labs
**Lab 1.1: The Caesar Cipher**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 1.1: *Define encryption, decryption, plaintext, ciphertext, and encryption/decryption key, and explain their use in cryptography;*  1.3: *Use early cipher methods such as a Caesar cipher or substitution cipher to encrypt/decrypt data.*  
**Lab work:** In this lab, students add content to a plaintext file, and use a simple shift cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages.The lab enables students to understand the terms and properties of cryptography, as well as to gain familiarity with the Caesar cipher.
**On their own:** Students can put in their own phrases to encrypt and decrypt messages.

**Lab 1.2: The ROTn Shift Cipher**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 1.2: *Describe attack scenarios against an encryption algorithm;* 1.3: *Use early cipher methods such as a Caesar cipher or substitution cipher to encrypt/decrypt data.* 
**Lab work:** In this lab, students work backwards from the encrypted text of Lab 1.  They enter the ciphertext, and use an algorithm to display all of the possible solutions.
**On their own:** Students can put in their own ciphertext from Lab 1 and run analysis on it.  Instructors can give students other ciphertext strings (using the shift from lab 1) to analyze, or students can swap ciphertext strings to decrypt.

**Lab 1.3: Substitution Ciphers**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 1.3: *Use early cipher methods such as a Caesar cipher or substitution cipher to encrypt/decrypt data.* 
**Lab work:** In this lab, students manipulate an alphabet to create different substitution keys. They then encrypt and decrypt different phrases using the substitution key(s) they create.
**On their own:** Students can put in their own plaintext and run it through different substitution keys.  Instructors can give students other ciphertext strings or substitution keys to analyze, or students can swap ciphertext strings and substitution keys.

**Lab 1.4: Frequency Analysis**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 1.2: *Describe attack scenarios against an encryption algorithm.*
**Lab work:** In this lab, students calculate frequencies of letters, digrams, and trigrams to apply frequency analysis techniques.
**On their own:** Students can analyze different ciphertexts or plaintexts to explore patterns.

## Unit 2 Labs
**Lab 2.1: Public Key Encryption with RSA**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 2.1: *Explain how asymmetric (public key) encryption works;*  2.2: *Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and the need for public key cryptography;* 2.4 *Identify commonly used algorithms for asymmetric encryption.* 
**Lab work:** In this lab, students work in pairs or small groups to create key pairs, exchange public keys, and encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA algorithm.
**On their own:** Students can practice sharing their public keys with other students and exchanging encrypted messages with them.

**Lab 2.2: Key Agreement (Exchange)**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 2.3: *Explain the use of key exchange/agreement protocols in cryptography;* 2.2: *Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and the need for public key cryptography.*  
**Lab work:** In this lab, students learn more about the math behind public key encryption.  They work with a partner or as small groups to generate a key pair, exchange public keys, and create a session key. They then exchange messages and use the session key to encrypt and decrypt messages to each other.
**On their own:** Students can practice modular arithmetic by working through different key exchanges with other partners or groups.

## Unit 3 Lab
**Lab 3.1: Verifying the Integrity of a Download**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 3.4: *Illustrate how hashing works using online tools.* 
**Lab work:** In this lab, students download an executable file and then use an online tool to calculate the hash value of the download.  They then return to the site of the download, and look up what the hash value of the file was before download.  Last, they compare the hashes to see if they are the same or different.
**On their own:** Students can practice calculating hash values of different files and looking up hash values online.

## Unit 4 Lab
**Lab 4.1: Digital Certificates and Certification Paths**
**Learning Objective(s) covered:** 4.2: *Explain the role of digital certificates and certificate authorities in secure communications;* 4.3: *Illustrate how digital signatures work using software.* 
**Lab work:** In this lab, students explore a digital certificate, identifying its parts and features. They then explore the certificate path, noting intermediate certificates and root certificates.
**On their own:** Students can look up other digital certificates and explore their certification paths online.
